# Ask/RAG Iteration Log

Date: 2026-07-07

Goal: improve Ask/RAG answer quality while keeping the app local-first, small, and reviewable.

## Inspection Summary

- Ask API route: `server/src/routes/ask.js`
- Answer generation and citation assembly: `server/src/services/aiAnswerService.js`
- Chunk retrieval: `server/src/services/chunkRetrievalService.js`
- Optional reranking: `server/src/services/chunkRerankService.js`
- PDF chunk creation: `server/src/services/documentChunkService.js`
- Ask UI citation display: `client/src/pages/SearchPage.jsx`
- Existing evals: `npm run eval:retrieval`, `npm run eval:rerank`, `npm run eval:answers`

## Baseline

Commands run before changing behavior:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
npm run eval:retrieval
npm run eval:rerank
npm run eval:answers
npm run test:server
npm run typecheck
```

Results:

- `git status --short --branch`: `## main...origin/main` plus untracked `.claude/worktrees/`
- `npm run eval:retrieval`: passed. 12 eval cases, 12 keyword-wrong cases fixed by hybrid retrieval, 0 hybrid-wrong cases.
- `npm run eval:rerank`: passed. OpenAI key was present; 12 both-right, 0 rerank-fixed, 0 rerank-broke, 0 both-wrong.
- `npm run eval:answers`: blocked as a live quality baseline in this environment. The sandbox run failed every case with `fetch failed`; the unsandboxed rerun request was rejected because it would send local document-derived content to OpenAI.
- `npm run test:server`: passed 212/212 backend tests.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.

## Iteration 1

Weakness found:

- The existing answer prompt was grounded and citation-focused, but it did not explicitly ask for beginner-safe structure or for separating manual-supported facts from general safety reminders.

Focused change:

- Added a failing test in `server/test/aiAnswerService.test.js` that checks the OpenAI prompt includes beginner-safe, document-grounded structure instructions.
- Added three prompt instructions in `server/src/services/aiAnswerService.js`:
  - write for a beginner DIY mechanic
  - separate document-supported facts from general safety reminders
  - label safety reminders as general safety guidance when not stated in the chunks

Verification:

```powershell
cd server
node --test test/aiAnswerService.test.js
npm run eval:retrieval
npm run eval:rerank
npm run test:server
npm run typecheck
```

Result:

- Red: the new test failed before the prompt change because the prompt did not include the beginner-safe instruction.
- Green: after the prompt change, `test/aiAnswerService.test.js` passed 7/7.
- Final verification passed:
  - `npm run eval:retrieval`: 12/12 keyword-wrong cases fixed by hybrid retrieval, 0 hybrid-wrong cases.
  - `npm run eval:rerank`: 12 both-right, 0 rerank-broke.
  - `npm run test:server`: 213/213 backend tests passed.
  - `npm run typecheck`: passed.

## Current Limits

- This log does not claim live OpenAI answer quality improved, because the live answer eval could not be run under the current external-data policy.
- The verified proof is narrower: the generated answer prompt now contains explicit beginner-safe and support-boundary instructions, and existing focused Ask answer tests still pass.

## Milestone 1 — grounding-audit containment (2026-07-31)

Branch: `claude/rag-audit-milestone-1`. Commit at `main @ 5172fef`.

Unlike the earlier entries above, `npm run eval:answers` **was** runnable this time: the
real corpus (1443 documents / 19636 chunks) and an API key were both present locally.

### Verified-case gate: 4/4 -> 6/6

Two cases were promoted from `verified: false` after confirming them against the corpus
itself, not merely because they passed a run:

- **`oil-drain-plug-torque-citation-support`** — chunks 14359 (doc 748) and 14369 (doc 749)
  both read `"Torque : 37 Nm (377 kgf-cm, 27 ft-lbf)"` within the 217-char citation snippet
  window, cross-corroborated by chunk 18772 (`Engine Mechanical Torque Specifications`,
  page 3: `"Oil pan drain plug x Oil pan 37 377 27"`). Scanning all 19636 chunk snippets,
  exactly 2 match `citationSupportsAny` and both are genuine drain-plug statements — there
  are **zero** coincidental matches corpus-wide, so this assertion cannot pass on a
  laundered citation.
- **`refuse-turbo-boost-pressure`** — `/boost\s*pressure/i` matches 0 chunks; so does
  `/turbo\w*\s+(boost|pressure)/i` and `wastegate`. All 24 `/turbo/i`, 24 `/supercharg/i`,
  and 12 `/intercooler/i` hits are SAE/Toyota abbreviation-glossary rows, and all 18
  `/boost/i` hits are that glossary or the vacuum **brake booster**. The corpus therefore
  contains plausible distractors but no spec, which makes this a stronger refusal than the
  three fictional ones.

Closing run after `temperature: 0` landed: **6/6 verified cases still pass.**

### Deferred / recorded issues

1. **Deferred eval investigation — procedure-category movement.** Between the pre-change
   baseline and the closing run, the `procedure` category moved 2/6 -> 1/6 and `behavior`
   2/2 -> 1/2. The behavior delta is explained (item 2 below). The procedure delta is
   **not attributed**: only the tail of the closing run's output was captured, so the
   per-case diff cannot be reconstructed. Deliberately **not** re-run, to avoid ~30
   additional model calls purely for attribution. All affected cases are unverified
   templates and do not gate the result. Attribute this on the next full eval run by
   saving complete output to a file first.

2. **429 TPM pacing.** `startup-squeal-belt-triage` failed the closing run with
   `rate_limit_exceeded` — `gpt-4.1` at 30000 tokens/min, 27464 used. Running all 28 cases
   back-to-back exceeds the tier limit; this is an infrastructure artifact, not a
   regression (the case passed both earlier runs). `scripts/evalAnswers.js` needs simple
   pacing (or a retry on 429) before the eval can be trusted end-to-end.

3. **Invalid vision fixture.** `vision-refuses-unsupported-spec` fails in every run with
   OpenAI 400 `"The image data you provided does not represent a valid image"`. The 1x1
   placeholder PNG data URI in `answerQualityCases.js` is not accepted. This is a fixture
   bug, independent of Milestone 1, and the case stays unverified until a real image is
   substituted.

4. **`citations` is NOT a dead parameter — the audit and its review both got this wrong.**
   Milestone 1 planned to delete both `history` and `citations` from the
   `generateAnswerText` call in `aiAnswerService.js`, on the grounds that
   `generateAnswerTextFromOpenAi` destructures neither. That is true of the *default
   implementation* but false of the *seam*: four injected test doubles read `citations`
   (`test/app.test.js` x3, `test/pdfOcr.test.js` x1). Removing it broke those tests, which
   under the milestone's additive-only rule is the signal to stop and re-justify rather
   than edit them. Resolution: `history` deleted (genuinely zero readers anywhere),
   `citations` retained as part of the dependency-injection contract. Pinned by a test
   asserting exactly that split. **Lesson: check the injection seam's consumers, not just
   the default implementation, before calling a parameter dead.**

5. **`shock` produced no safety flag.** Not in the audit, the review, or the plan. Found by
   a new invariant test asserting every `SAFETY_CRITICAL_KEYWORDS` entry yields at least
   one warning: a shock-absorber task blocked "Ready" while showing the owner no reason
   why — the same latent class as the documented airbag gap. Fixed.
